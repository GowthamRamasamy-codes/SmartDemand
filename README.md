PROJECT NAME : SMARTDEMAND

Objective:
To develop a robust system that leverages AI for climatic prediction and ML for demand forecasting to optimize the supply chain of fruits and vegetables, ensuring better inventory management and reduced wastage.

Overview:
This project aims to create a predictive model that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to accurately forecast the demand for fruits and vegetables. The AI component will analyze climatic data to predict weather conditions, which significantly impact crop yields. The ML component will use historical sales data, market trends, and climatic predictions to forecast future demand, helping retailers and suppliers manage their inventory more effectively.

Components:

AI for Climatic Prediction:

Data Collection: Gather historical and real-time climatic data, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and other relevant weather parameters.
Model Development: Use AI techniques, such as neural networks or ensemble models, to analyze and predict future climatic conditions.
Output: Generate accurate weather forecasts that impact the growth and availability of various fruits and vegetables.
ML for Demand Forecasting:

Data Collection: Collect historical sales data of fruits and vegetables, including factors like seasonality, promotions, and market trends.
Feature Engineering: Combine climatic predictions with historical sales data to create features that influence demand.
Model Development: Use ML algorithms, such as regression models, time series analysis, or more advanced methods like XGBoost or LSTM, to forecast future demand.
Output: Provide demand forecasts that help in planning inventory, procurement, and distribution.
Steps to Implement:

Data Acquisition:

Collect climatic data from weather stations, meteorological services, and IoT sensors.
Gather sales data from retailers, supermarkets, and marketplaces.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess climatic data and sales data.
Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature scaling.
Model Training and Validation:

Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train AI models for climatic prediction and validate their accuracy.
Train ML models for demand forecasting using the features derived from climatic predictions and historical sales data.
Integration and Deployment:
